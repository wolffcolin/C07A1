KerPlop


Implements Drawable (no interaction and not actually a game piece, so doesn't extend GamePiece)
	Doormat 
Extends GamePiece, implements Moveable
	Minion.  Moves right (jumping over other pieces) until it reaches the rightmost space. Then moves left (jumping over other pieces) until it reaches the leftmost space. Continues in this pattern indefinitely.
	RandomMotionPiece. Since there would be a couple of pieces that move randomly, to avoid repeating code an abstract child class of GamePiece that implemented Moveable was implemented. No  objects of this type were created (it's abstract), and this piece does not override interact.
	Sniper and Unicorn move randomly
Extends GamePiece with various InteractionResult
	NONE - Minion.
	HIT/NONE - BumbleBee (interacts on same location)
	KILL/NONE - Sniper (will kill a player that comes within 3 squares, unless there's another object in between (a piece on the same square as the player also "blocks" the sniper's shot).
	KILL/NONE - Kangalo. (will kill a player that is on the same square or beside it)
	ADVANCE/NONE - Unicorn (interacts on same location)
	GET_POINT/NONE - Prize (Gives a point if the player lands on it).
